The verification process ensures that the certificate was genuinely issued by RanchiMall. When you choose the "Verify" option, the system performs three checks:
It verifies the same using these three checks:
i) Verification of Sender Address: The system validates if the sender's blockchain address is one of RanchiMall's authorized addresses.
ii) Verification of Receiver Address: The system verifies if the receiver's blockchain address is also one of RanchiMall's authorized addresses.
iii) Certificate Type Validation: The system confirms if the certificate corresponds to one of the following categories: Internship, Employment, Volunteership, or Participation.
If the certificate passes all three checks, you will be redirected to the RanchiMall website, where a verification message will confirm that the certificate is indeed verified by RanchiMall.
